# Objectives
Our objective is developing a mobile aplication that digitalized the notebook used in many brazilian cantines to register kids' snacks at school. This will allow parents to have an easier access to what their children eat and allow them to program snacks, visualize expenses and check the cantine's notices. 

# How to initialize the project
1. The most stable version is always in the main branch. Copy the repository and make sure to access the path ./Cantina-Conecta/CantinaConecta to start the app. 

2. Then, initialize the project typing npx expo start in the terminal. You should have an updated react-native framework to navigate the aplication properly. 

3. Scan the QR code shown in the terminal and use the Expo Go app to access it.
